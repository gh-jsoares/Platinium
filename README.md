# Platinium

Platinium let's you create any kind of Server-Client based application. All the data handling, connection pipes, and package serialization is done. You just need to create a Plugin and place it at the Server /Plugins folder. 
Inside it provides the IPlugin interface and all libraries for you to create your own plugin.

Want to share the screen with your friend(s)? No problem, just create a library that takes screenshots of the desktop and pack it in a package and it automatically sends it away!
Want to make a simple Chat application? You can do that also! You just need to create the library and load it to the server. Platinium handles all the hard work.
